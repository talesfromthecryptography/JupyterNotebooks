    "# Montgomery Representation of $GF(p^k)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In cryptographic applications, a Galois field $GF(p^k)$ are typically represented directly as elemnts of the ring $\\mathbb Z_p[x]$  --- that is, as polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb Z_p$. Concretely, these are stored as lists of coefficients because the indeterminate $x$ of the polynomial is really just a formal marker of the degree. \n",
    "\n",
    "But as we have seen, even multiplication in $GF(p^k)$ is complicated by the need to reduce polynomials by some fixed irreducible polynomial $m$ of degree $k$. This is not usually a big problem for $p=2$. But it would be an obstruction for other primes."
